## General Information
- **Project Description**: This project involves analyzing loan data from a consumer finance company to mitigate credit risk. The objective is to leverage exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning to identify patterns and indicators of loan default, enabling the company to make informed lending decisions.

- **Business Context**: The lending company specializes in providing various loans to urban customers. It faces the challenge of assessing loan applicants' creditworthiness to minimize credit loss. This involves managing two key risks:
   1. **Risk of Non-Approval**: Rejecting loans to creditworthy applicants leads to missed business opportunities.
   2. **Risk of Default**: Approving loans to applicants likely to default results in financial losses.
   
   By using data analytics, the company aims to predict loan defaults, optimize lending decisions, and mitigate credit risk effectively.

- **Key Business Problems Addressed**:
   1. **Identifying Loan Default Risk**: Develop a predictive model to identify applicants at risk of default.
   2. **Optimizing Lending Decisions**: Make informed decisions about loan approvals, rejections, or modifications based on applicant profiles and historical loan data.

- **Dataset**: The dataset used for analysis is "loan.csv," containing loan application data from 2007 to 2011.
